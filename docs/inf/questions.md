## Why do some commands need a tool?

It simply requires a tool to function properly.

It needs a tool from the game itself that has a handle. An example of a handle is a sword. You hold the sword by it's handle which is usually an invisible block.

If there are no tools in the game then you can not use the command.

You can't spawn a tool in through a script.
